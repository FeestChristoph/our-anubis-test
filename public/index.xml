      <title>Platforms for Good</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://diagonalising.com/post/2021-03-23-platforms-for-good/index_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In 2017, at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.weforum.org/&#34;&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Gates and a group of leading philanthropists announced the launch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.co-impact.org/&#34;&gt;Co-Impact&lt;/a&gt;, a platform hub aimed at working collaboratively to drive social change at scale in three fields—health, education, and economic opportunity. This initiative combines platforms’ design with the need to address societal grand challenges, as embodied by the UN’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdgs.un.org/goals&#34;&gt;sustainable development goals&lt;/a&gt;. Is Co-impact an isolated example, or is it part of a wider phenomenon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pervasiveness of platforms highlights how these organizations grow and thrive thanks to the interaction with the ecosystem and users’ engagement. Platforms have a crucial influence on market competitiveness, for example, among vendors or between platform providers. Instead, the contribution of platforms to social change is poorly examined despite an expanding array of public and private initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schemes similar to Co-Impact have sprung up over the past decade, and several were initiated with the support of national or international institutions—for example, the European Commission supports the Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innovation (&lt;a href=&#34;https://capssi.eu/&#34;&gt;CAPSSI&lt;/a&gt;). When explaining their platforms’ core traits, founders emphasize that the social intent determines a platform design substantially different from the one of Uber, Facebook, and other conventional platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the dimensions of a platform design that enables both sustainability and value generation for society and the platform’s market? If Wikipedia, having &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/01/09/happy-birthday-wikipedia&#34;&gt;turned 20&lt;/a&gt; this year, and Co-impact are any guide, such dimensions exist. If we tease them out and make them accessible, we can provide the right building blocks to enable more platforms for good to enter the arena. Ultimately, this strategy can prove to be a game-changer to address societal grand challenges and scale up the positive effects of platforms on social change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This is a first - do it open and digital</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://diagonalising.com/post/2020-11-16-this-is-a-first-do-it-open-and-digital/index_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is one week since Pfizer &amp;amp; BioNTech announced that their first interim analysis “&lt;a href=&#34;https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against-covid-19&#34;&gt;indicates a [COVID-19] vaccine efficacy rate above 90%, at seven days after the second dose&lt;/a&gt;.” Similar announcements will arrive over the next few weeks for other vaccine candidates currently in phase 3 clinical trials. With regulatory approvals expedited, it is plausible that by Spring 2021, several vaccines are on the market and deployed. Companies and governments are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/11/14/the-promise-of-the-new-covid-19-vaccine-is-immense&#34;&gt;preparing logistics and drawing up distribution schemes&lt;/a&gt; at speed for a vaccination campaign that will take years and involve a number of different vaccines. To build trust and supply timely data to the public, companies, researchers and policy makers should strive to make the global COVID-19 fight the first digital, and open-data vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many countries have developed and released COVID-19 warning apps. These apps could be adapted to easily record the details of the vaccine (type, batch etc.) that an individual receives. Furthermore, the apps could remind users to get their second shot (most vaccines require a 2-dose schedule) or a booster later in 2021 (as immunity is likely to drop over time). Above all, such functionalities are practical, keeping track of appointments, vaccinations and test results over the next years. Furthermore, users could opt to donate their data anonymously to research projects. The use of warning apps would broaden further, reaching deeper into the economically and socially more active generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on the vaccination campaign should be open and made public with county-level granularity. Weekly updates on the dispensed doses/vaccines will help to build trust in the distribution schemes, adapt policy responses, and guide the development of the next generation of vaccines. Governments quickly mobilised cash and the public has a legitimate interest in timely information; they should prevail over commercial confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 will not go away soon; it will also not be the last pandemic. If we handle this global response with digital tools and open data, we can lay the groundwork for what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unmet needs</title>

&lt;p&gt;Advanced therapies cure diseases instead of treating symptoms. Machine learning will help reach more patients sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term advanced therapies is often used to describe interventions in the vanguard of biomedicine: Based on cells, genes or tissue engineering these ‘living drugs’ can treat chronic conditions and often restore the functionality of diseased tissue. Their first wave has arrived in the clinic, most notably &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/immunotherapy/types/CAR-T-cell-therapy&#34;&gt;CAR-T cells&lt;/a&gt; battling blood cancer and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/cellular-gene-therapy-products/what-gene-therapy&#34;&gt;gene therapies&lt;/a&gt; for rare diseases such as muscular dystrophy. Overall, there are now close to 20 advanced therapy medicinal products (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/marketing-authorisation/advanced-therapies/advanced-therapy-classification&#34;&gt;ATMP&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/cellular-gene-therapy-products/approved-cellular-and-gene-therapy-products&#34;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fda.gov/&#34;&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ema.europa.eu/en&#34;&gt;EMA&lt;/a&gt;, the respective regulatory authorities in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients are being cured with advanced therapies every day and more is to come. According to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://alliancerm.org/sector-report/h1-2020-report-pdf/&#34;&gt;latest report&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://alliancerm.org/&#34;&gt;Alliance for Regenerative Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the sector’s foremost trade body, over 1,000 companies are developing new advanced therapies and over 1,000 clinical trials are running. The industry is maturing and, important for this perspective, large amounts of high-quality data are generated from manufacturing, from all phases of clinical development and trials, and from post marketing follow-up; that data comprises electronic health records, histology, medical imaging, blood screens and extensive characterisation of each advanced therapy product. Here is the opportunity to bring machine learning into play to boost productivity of existing advanced therapies and to develop next generation products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sifting through large and diverse data sets uncovering correlations and inferring causality – that’s what machine learning algorithms do extremely well. They analyse medical images such as X-rays and select potentially useful drugs from huge databases of chemical compounds with often superhuman performance. Machine learning will be a key tool in many domains of healthcare. How could advanced therapies benefit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with manufacturing. Setting up and maintaining a robust manufacturing process is a crucial early part of the clinical development of advanced therapies and a persistent cost factor of their application. Cell therapies, such as the currently approved CAR-T cell therapies, are often produced for individual patients from their own tissue as starting material: Over the course of two to three weeks highly qualified staff operate bioreactors in clean rooms, transfer genes to target the tumour and perform quality controls. Small variations in materials and handling can cause substantial changes to the final product’s quality and thus determine how well it works. Machine learning can power imaging and other sensing modalities for much needed non-invasive product characterisation and continuous monitoring. Adding further steps towards automation, including robotic assistance, could lead to an integrated manufacturing process that is the basis for increased output and faster innovation across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next are clinical trials. Advanced therapies, as any new drug, go through a standardised sequence of clinical tests to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Their complex mode of action defies pharmacology rules, which makes previously straightforward steps such as dose finding much harder. It also leads to an extensive number of biomarkers – telltale parameters for the functionality of an organ – being monitored. Scrutinising such deep data beyond traditional primary and secondary endpoints is a critical advantage, both for measuring performance and for achieving a fuller understanding of the mode of action of an advanced therapy product. Machine learning could then help refine measures of success, predict the effective dose patient by patient and prevent failures; its analyses could also reveal unforeseen effects that open up new application areas, for instance systemic benefits or improvements of other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining a data-rich trajectory of an advanced therapy product with machine learning may bring the greatest prize of all: linking manufacturing to clinical performance. Doctors would then be able to adapt a product to suit the patient best through tweaks in the manufacturing process. Such a capability would give rise to a platform technology where multiple products and thus clinical effects can be generated reliably from the same starting material. Think of it as drug repurposing on demand. Machine learning is already a great tool for diagnosis and discovery; by turning the complexity of advanced therapies into versatility it would help cure patients more directly than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Manifesto</title>
      <link>https://diagonalising.com/post/2022-01-06-manifesto/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://diagonalising.com/post/2022-01-06-manifesto/index_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We are starting the Diagonalising blog with this short manifesto, setting out our ambition and rationale for ‘going public’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that can be digitalised will be digitalised. Many areas of public and private life are changing, some gradually, others abruptly, often intersecting with other megatrends. We want the Diagonalising blog to be an outlet where we describe patterns we observe, where we bring clarity into our observations and where we share our perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagonalsing implies a foundation, a process, a destination. We are two professionals with experience crossing academia and translational research; we have learned to analyze complex relationships, simplify them, and represent the core ties through testable models. This process is iterative, dynamic, error-prone and it may leave you opposite of the origin. Our destination is a better understanding, a new approach or fresh insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is reaching out. In a rather undigitized era, Alexander von Humboldt combined daring scientific fieldwork with popular writing that allowed him to reach out beyond the academic community, addressing a wider audience and popularising many aspects of science. Fast forward two centuries and there are countless ways to engage. The Diagonalising blog is ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are blogging through projections and snippets. These two types of posts are the bones of our contributions. Projections develop a point-of-view and start a conversation; snippets collect one or more short observations, things we take note of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started, join the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mathematical notation in a Hugo project can be enabled by using third party JavaScript libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example we will be using &lt;a href=&#34;https://katex.org/&#34;&gt;KaTeX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a partial under &lt;code&gt;/layouts/partials/math.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within this partial reference the &lt;a href=&#34;https://katex.org/docs/autorender.html&#34;&gt;Auto-render Extension&lt;/a&gt; or host these scripts locally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include the partial in your templates like so:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if or .Params.math .Site.Params.math }}
{{ partial &amp;quot;math.html&amp;quot; . }}
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable KaTex globally set the parameter &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in a project&amp;rsquo;s configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable KaTex on a per page basis include the parameter &lt;code&gt;math: true&lt;/code&gt; in content files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the online reference of &lt;a href=&#34;https://katex.org/docs/supported.html&#34;&gt;Supported TeX Functions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#examples&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inline math: $$ \varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887… $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } }
$$&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emoji Support</title>
      <link>https://diagonalising.com/post/emoji-support/</link>

      <guid>https://diagonalising.com/post/emoji-support/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/functions/emojify/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;emojify&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function can be called directly in templates or &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/#inline-shortcodes&#34;&gt;Inline Shortcodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable emoji globally, set &lt;code&gt;enableEmoji&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in your site’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/&#34;&gt;configuration&lt;/a&gt; and then you can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files; e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;emojify&#34;&gt;🙈&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;:see_no_evil:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;emojify&#34;&gt;🙉&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;:hear_no_evil:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;emojify&#34;&gt;🙊&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;:speak_no_evil:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/&#34;&gt;Emoji cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt; is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N.B.&lt;/strong&gt; The above steps enable Unicode Standard emoji characters and sequences in Hugo, however the rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform. To style the emoji you can either use a third party emoji font or a font stack; e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;.emoji {
font-family: Apple Color Emoji,Segoe UI Emoji,NotoColorEmoji,Segoe UI Symbol,Android Emoji,EmojiSymbols;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
